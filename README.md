## README.md: Dynamic User-Agent Application in Security Tools

### Overview

The Python script detailed here is a versatile tool designed to enhance security testing practices by integrating a dynamic user-agent functionality into various commonly used security tools. This script, which can be a valuable asset for penetration testers and cybersecurity researchers, aims to evade simple user-agent based detections and add an additional layer of stealth to their security assessments.

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic User-Agent Integration:** The script fetches a comprehensive list of user-agents from a remote source and applies them randomly to each tool's requests, making the traffic generated by these tools more inconspicuous and less likely to be flagged by basic security systems.

2. **Support for Multiple Security Tools:** The script currently extends this functionality to a wide range of security tools, including Nmap, Curl, Wget, Sqlmap, ffuf, feroxbuster, Nikto, and Gobuster with more tools being tested and added.

3. **Ease of Use:** By simply executing the script with the desired tool as a command-line argument, users can seamlessly incorporate a random user-agent into their security testing tools.

### Technical Details

#### User-Agent List Acquisition
The script begins by downloading a list of user-agents from a designated URL. It saves this list locally and reuses it for subsequent operations to minimize network requests.

#### Integration with Security Tools
For each supported tool, a specific function is defined to:
- Randomly select a user-agent from the downloaded list.
- Construct and execute the tool’s command with the selected user-agent.
- Handle any errors that arise during the execution of these tools.

#### Modular Design
Each tool's integration is handled by a separate function, allowing for easy expansion or modification to include additional tools or functionalities in the future.

### Usage

The script is designed to be straightforward to use. Users can invoke the script from the command line, followed by the name of the security tool and its respective arguments. For example:

```bash
python cleanup_crew.py nmap -v -sV -p- 127.0.0.1
```

This command would run an Nmap scan on the localhost with all ports, using a randomly selected user-agent.

### Conclusion

This script stands as a testament to the importance of adaptability and stealth in modern cybersecurity practices. By dynamically applying different user-agents to security tools, it offers an enhanced layer of obscurity, making it a valuable addition to any security professional’s toolkit.
